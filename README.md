# Welcome to the NJIT FAQBot!
### Project Introduction 
---
The NJIT FAQBot is a student driven project that has been organized by Professor Williams. The focus of the project is to give students a hands on experience collaboratively working in an agile environment that is similarly recognized in large tech companies.

The idea behind the NJIT FAQBot is to create a *smart QA forum* to help students find answers to their questions more efficiently.
